This is a password generator for Linux. This is a script you could use in the command line to output a random string.
The random string depends on action of input used during script execution.
For example, if you run:
./genPass
The output will be a random string of uppercase, lowercase, and/or numbers ranging from 8-32 characters.
If you run the script with the argument of any string, it will return a random string of equal length.
./genPass aNeyStr
If you run the script with the arguments of netagive or postive integers, a random string will be returned with that length.
./genPass 12
./genPass -12
Only running the script, string, or integers are accepted as input.
